    "description": "The `order_items` table contains detailed information about individual items within a customer's order. It acts as the central fact table, linking to products, users, and the main order record. Each entry represents a single line item, capturing its unique ID, the associated order, user, and product, as well as its status and price.\n\nThis data is primarily used for the following purposes:\n\n* **Sales and Revenue Analysis**: It allows for the calculation of total sales, average order value, and revenue from specific products or categories.\n* **Order and Fulfillment Tracking**: The table provides granular status updates for each item in an order (e.g., 'Shipped', 'Delivered'), which is crucial for monitoring fulfillment and identifying bottlenecks.\n* **Customer Behavior Analysis**: By joining with the `users` table, this data can reveal purchasing patterns, such as which users are buying which items and when.\n* **Profitability Analysis**: It can be used to analyze the performance of individual products by looking at their sale price and comparing it to cost data from other tables.",
