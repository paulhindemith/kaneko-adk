    "description": "The `events` table stores information about user activities and interactions on a website or application. Each record in this table represents a specific event, such as a page view or a click, and includes details like the user who performed the action, the session it belongs to, and the timestamp.\n\nThis data is primarily used for the following purposes:\n\n* **User Behavior Analysis**: It helps in understanding how users navigate the site, what content they interact with, and the typical paths they take.\n* **Traffic and Conversion Tracking**: The table allows for the analysis of traffic sources, helping to identify which channels are most effective at driving user engagement and conversions.\n* **Customer Journey Mapping**: By tracking the sequence of events, this data can be used to map out a customer's journey from their first interaction to a final purchase or other conversion.\n* **Personalization**: The event data can be used to personalize user experiences by recommending content or products based on past behavior.",
