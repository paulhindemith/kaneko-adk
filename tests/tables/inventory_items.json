    "description": "The `inventory_items` table tracks individual items within the inventory, providing a detailed record of each unit of a product. It includes information on the item's lifecycle, from its creation to when it was sold, along with its cost and associated product details.\n\nThis data is primarily used for the following purposes:\n\n* **Inventory Management**: It allows for precise tracking of stock levels, movement of goods, and the status of individual items.\n* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Analysis**: By recording the cost of each item when it was sold, this table is crucial for calculating the cost of goods sold and determining profitability.\n* **Supply Chain and Fulfillment Analysis**: It helps in understanding the time an item spends in inventory, allowing for optimization of stocking and fulfillment processes.\n* **Product-Level Reporting**: The table links back to the `products` and `distribution_centers` tables, enabling a detailed analysis of sales and costs on a per-item basis.",
