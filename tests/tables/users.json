    "description": "The `users` table contains information about individual customers. It serves as a dimension table that provides detailed demographic and geographic context for user behavior, rather than transactional data. Each entry represents a unique user and includes personal details, location, and the source of their traffic.\n\nThis data is primarily used for the following purposes:\n\n* **Customer Segmentation**: It allows for the analysis of customer behavior by demographics like age, gender, and location, which is key for targeted marketing campaigns.\n* **Geographic Analysis**: By including location data such as city, state, and postal code, this table helps in understanding customer distribution and regional purchasing trends.\n* **Traffic Source Analysis**: The `traffic_source` field is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of different marketing channels in acquiring new users.\n* **User Profile Enrichment**: It serves as a central hub for linking other transactional tables (like `orders` and `events`) to specific user profiles, providing a holistic view of the customer journey.",
