    "description": "The `products` table stores general information about each product, serving as a master list. It contains details like the product's name, category, brand, and retail price. This table typically holds one record per unique product, separate from the `inventory_items` table, which tracks individual units of that product.\n\nThis data is primarily used for the following purposes:\n\n* **Product Catalog and Management**: It provides a central source of truth for all products, which is essential for e-commerce sites and inventory systems.\n* **Merchandising and Marketing Analysis**: The table's category, brand, and department fields are used to analyze sales performance by product type and inform marketing strategies.\n* **Pricing and Profitability Analysis**: By storing the retail price and cost, this table is foundational for calculating profit margins and setting prices.\n* **Joining with Transactional Data**: It's a key dimension table that links with transactional data, such as `order_items`, to provide rich context for sales and customer behavior analysis.",
